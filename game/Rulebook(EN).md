# HEX BLACKHOLE
## Components
- 1 First Player Marker
- 1 Game Board
- 22 Number Tiles (two sets of tiles numbered 1 to 11)
## Game Setup
- Place the game board at the center of the table.
- Place the first player marker randomly on one side.
- Each player takes 11 tiles, shuffles them well, and places them face down in front of them. (Except for the tile numbered 1, tiles numbered 2 to 11 are in the player's color, while the tile numbered 1 belongs to the opponent's color and is shuffled into the deck.)
- Each player draws three tiles from their deck and holds them in their hand.
## Game Progress (2 players)
- Each player secretly places one tile face down.
- Both players reveal their tiles simultaneously, and the player with the lower number places their tile on the game board first. (If the numbers are the same, the player with a tile of the same color as the first player marker places the tile first.)
- Repeat the above steps until there is no space left on the board.
## Game End
The game ends when there is only one empty space left on the game board.

Remove all tiles adjacent to the remaining empty space from the game board.

## Scoring
A "non-surrounded" tile (a tile with no adjacent tiles of the same color) scores the number written on it.

A "surrounded" tile scores 1 point each.

Flip the first player marker, and proceed with the next round. 

The player with the highest total score after two rounds wins.
